Global setup: echo = TRUE meaning always show code in the Rmarkdown

If include = FALSE, then will not show

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Texts and simple codes

Main text. **text**, *text*, Text~subtext~, Text^subtext^ .

```{r}
1 + 1
```

The textbooks are written in R markdown format.

## Output figures

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```

## Display Data

```{r}
cars
```

## In-line R Code

Scientific research shows that 1+1 = `r 1+1` . (using \`r\`).

As it's outside of R code chunk, "command & enter does not work".

To knit PDF format:

```{r}
#install.packages("tinytex")
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Knitting Rmarkdown will run all the codes in the document, therefore for installing, after installing a package, *comment* the code to deactivate it.
